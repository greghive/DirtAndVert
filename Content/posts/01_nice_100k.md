# Nice Côte D’Azur 100k DNF

## 30 September, 2022

### What was the race?

Last weekend I flew to Nice Côte D’Azur to race the [Roubion 110k][1] ultra marathon. Starting high up in the mountains of the Mercantour National Park, the course weaves its way over 5,000 meters of beautiful technical single track, traversing numerous mountain peaks before plunging down towards
the sparkling waters of the Mediterranean Sea and finishing on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice. The race forms part of the [UTMB World Series][2], with 3 running stones (lottery ticket entries) available for those who finish.

### Why did I enter?

In July, I raced Ultra Trail Snowdonia 100k and was blown away by the experience. Something about the UTMB World Series has captivated me. The fanfare that comes with such big events, the level of competition, all the incredible live coverage and of course, the chance to get to Chamonix and
race at UTMB itself. Chamonix has been a goal that I’ve been working towards for the last couple of years, and with the introduction of the World Series, I’m more excited and motivated than ever!

### How did it go?

As you can see from the title of this post, I did not finish the race. I withdrew at 64.7 miles with just 6 miles left to go. I’d done all of the climbing, with just a 10k descent into Nice to finish the race. My main goal was to complete the race and gain an additional 3 running stones for 
the UTMB lottery, which would have brought my total to 6. However, I failed to do this. Putting significant time, energy and money into a race in which you DNF stings. But was my race a failure? How upset, annoyed or frustrated should I really be? What successes were achieved along that 64.7 miles, and what lessons can be taken away to improve future races? Let’s see how it all went down.

### Roubion to Levens - 60k

Getting to the start line involved leaving Nice at 3:25am on shuttles buses that would take us to Roubion. Boarding the coaches was well organised and we were away on time. The lights of the bus dimmed and it felt good to close my eyes and (kind of) sleep for the approx 1:45 drive. After around an hour or so, the buses pulled off the road and into a car park. I thought that we had arrived quite early but as we all unloaded it was pretty clear we were not at the start line. I looked at a local noticeboard and could see ‘St Sauver Sur Tinee’. I checked the list of check points I'd created in Notes on my phone, and that was the first check point. After an hour and 15 minutes of standing around in the rain, trying to figure out what was going on, it turned out the buses were too large to navigate the mountain roads to Roubion. So we eventually boarded another set of buses and made our way to the start line. By the time we got there, the narrow cavelike starting funnel was already bursting full of runners, and by the time I was in the starting pen, I was stuck at the very back.

I checked my spare head torch, a small Petzl Bindi that I planned to use for the first hour before sunrise and it flashed a red light at me. No charge? What! (As it turns out, this light meant it was locked, not out of charge 🤦‍♂️, more on that later). I also realised in that moment that I didn’t pack a charger cable for that headtorch in my pack. I panicked a little, as that meant my only head torch was my main Petzl Nao+. I’d better make sure nothing happens to it, I thought. Now feeling a little uneasy. 

The race started and everyone slowly shuffled forwards. I knew that at some point after the start there would be some kind of gate all 700 people would need to filter through and onto the trails, and I was already stuck at the back. So once I was over the start line I put in a big effort on the downhill road section, so that I could pass as many people as possible. I didn’t know at the time, but there would have been about 600 people in front of me. I did my best, but sure enough I got stuck waiting to get through the gate. Even once I was through, it was all single track and everybody was restricted to moving at the pace of the slowest person near the front of the masses. I covered the first 3 miles in an excruciating 14:30min/mile, 15:58min/mile and 25:33 min/mile. I spent the opening couple of hours weaving my way through the large benches of people to find clear trails so that I could get into a proper rhythm. I put in some big surges at times as there were few opportunities to pass large groups. I hoped I hadn’t over done it, and was trying to avoid being frustrated. 

By the second checkpoint at Valdeblore La Colmaine I’d found space and began working up the first and largest climb of the day to summit at over 2,000 meters. Wow, it was big! The weather was cloudy and rainy which was such a shame, as I Imagine the views would have been spectacular. Once the summit was reached, it was then time for a very long technical downhill. My body held up well and through 50k I felt very strong as we hit some lovely runnable sections. I’d been fuelling well, but was hungry and I was pleased to reach the drop bag at the Levens checkpoint with 60km of the race complete. I stopped for the longest I’ve ever stopped at a checkpoint before, over 20 minutes. I ate, drank, and plugged my phone into charge on one of my power banks. My waterproof was soaking wet and I started to get cold as I'd stopped a while. I put on my North Face Thermoball underneath my waterproof jacket. It was too warm and bulky and as I tried to put everything bag in my pack it’s not the perfect neat bundle I’d achieved in my hotel room the day before. It’s large and feels slightly uncomfortable. I also notice that my dry bag is not done up properly, and some of my spare layers have gotten damp. A separate jacket in my drop bag would have been better, so that I didn’t have to unload my pack.

### Levens to Drap - 91k

Leaving Levens the second biggest climb of the day was underway. It was long and relentlessly steep. I started to feel quite drained. My body is not used to such long climbs. We reach the summit quicker than expected and a guy I’d be running with on and off for most of the day to my surprise pulls out at the summit checkpoint. “I am done” he says. I wish him well and start to descend to checkpoint 6 at Plan de Couthon. Suddenly, I’m moving well again, passing others runners who are now walking and I get a boost of energy as I dance my way dow the mountain, navigating the technical switch backs, I start to feel good again.

Another climb and the good feeling falls away. It’s steep and I started to become obsessed with looking at my watch. My pace started to drop and I was checking my watch constantly. It wasn't a long climb but it felt like it went on forever. It got dark, and foggy and the next 3 checkpoints seem dragged out. I tried to move well on the descents like I did earlier but I was struggling. Even using poles to descend I’ was nearly tripping over myself and the terrain.  I hit a flat section and was barely able to muster anything above a fast walk. I knew I was close to the finish but moving at this pace it’s still some way off. I put on more layers as I feel my core temperature drop as the intensity of my movements can no longer pump my heart quickly, and my muscles aren’t working hard enough to generate heat.

### Drap to Plateau Saint Michel - 100k

One more climb and then one more descent into Nice. I tell myself just get to the top of this climb, and then it’s all downhill. From the top of the climb, I could see the lights of Nice and I knew I was close. I just needed to drag myself through the final miles and I’d be done. Not how I wanted to finish the race, but the finish line is close. I felt awful. I don’t normally get blisters, I’ve been running long enough my feet are well callused over, but I could feel two very sore points on both feet and on my left, some kind of flap of skin lifting every time I push off on that side. The descents had finally taken their toll and there was a painful dull ache in my left shin. Descending to the checkpoint at Plateau Saint Michel everything hurt. The last 3 miles had taken around an hour and a half and my body was grinding to a halt.

As I approached the aid station, the voice that was telling me to stop for the last few hours was suddenly very loud. I decided I needed to sit for a moment, so I took my pack off and set it down on a chair and began filling up my flasks with every intention of continuing. However, as I sat down and stopped I suddenly got very cold. I put my Thermoball jacket on, but it was wet too and didn’t really help. I put my beanie on, and that did help. I sat there shivering and contemplated whether I was able to complete the final 6 miles given how slowly I’d be moving, my body temperature and the pain in my feet and left leg. I checked the battery on my main head torch and saw that I had around 1:30 on the lowest power mode left. The voice in my head that had been telling me to stop was now too loud to push away, and I said to the volunteers at the checkpoint that I wanted to withdraw. They were great. They got me a chair, wrapped me up, got me some hot soup and told me to try and warm up and think about it some more. I did as they said, but my mind was already made up. It was only 6 miles, but would likely have taken me a couple of hours, given the state I was in. I’m not sure I’d have made it. The volunteers kindly drove me down into Nice, back to my hotel where I got in the shower. When I got out I was still shivering vigorously. I got into bed fully clothed, took the duvets from both twin beds and put them over me. I’d been awake for 25 hours. Game over. Sleep.

### What were the successes?

Despite the apparent failure, there were several major successes. 

My technical downhill running continues to improve! I’ve made huge strides (literally) this year. My feet are quick and light, and my confidence is high. I struggled with descending for years and this time last year 20,000 feet of descent would’ve finished me off in no time. My body not only held up, but excelled and that feels fantastic. I’ve turned a weakness into a strength. Happy days. I felt great leaps in fitness. Through the 50k mark I felt a surge in energy, and ran strongly through 8 hours before any signs of fatigue appeared. That is a definite improvement, and the feeling of ease and flow I experienced over the first half of the course is absolutely the result of increased fitness. All the hours of training were clearly shown on race day. After hitting a rough spot around 70km, I managed to dig myself out of a hole and start moving well again. Typically in long races once I’m in that hole, I’ve found it difficult if not impossible to dig myself out. But finally I did it, and now I know that I can trust my body, and that it is capable of moving well again even when it feels like I’m toast. I have another long mountain race on my CV, with valuable experience I can build upon. I’ve also experienced racing abroad, which is somewhat unique, and the next race abroad should feel more straight forward now. I had no stomach issues. My iron gut continues to serve me well. My footwear was excellent. I wore the Hoka Mafate Speed 4’s and they held up on every terrain covered, even in the wet and mud. Absolute 10/10. I made a smart decision to withdraw. I always promise my family I’ll come home safe and in one piece, and that I achieved.

### Lessons learned 

The flashing red light on my Petzl Bindi was not indicating low / no battery. It was saying it was locked! So make sure you always know exactly how all of your kit works. Especially the bits you don't use very often. Getting frustrated with getting stuck at the start, and then trying to make up lost time with big efforts could well have contributed to my DNF. Yes it was crap to lose at least half an hour, but so is a DNF. Save those matches for when you really need them. My pack setup needs some work. It tends to be something I look at with a couple of weeks to go, as you don't need full mandatory mountain ultra kit for your 2 or 3 hour long runs. In future, I'm getting this all dialled well in advance, and making sure I'm reguarly training with full mandatory kit. Lastly, whilst it's smart to take your time at checkpoints, I need to stop taking luxurious 20 minute breaks ha! Over these really long races, it's amazing how much time you can lose by hanging around at checkpoints. Go look at the front runners and see how long they take. It's about 5 minutes...for the entire race!

It takes a good pinch of luck to finish a long ultra, and perhaps luck was not on my side. I did my best in the situations I found myself in, and that really is all you can do. I’d be lying if I said there wasn’t some disappointment remaining, not bringing home a finishers medal, and losing out on the opportunity to collect those 3 precious runnings stones. But as demonstrated above, a DNF is not a total failure. Everyones story will be different, but there will always be positive things you can take forward after a DNF. Think deeply about the experience and don’t just focus on the negative aspects. And of course, we all know the best way to make yourself feel better after a DNF. Sign up to the next race, and get back to work :)
