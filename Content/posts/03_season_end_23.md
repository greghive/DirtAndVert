# Wrapping up 2023

## 27 October, 2022

As 2022 draws to a close and the racing season is over, it's time to relax a little and enjoy some different activities. This period of active rest gives the body some respite from the constant pounding movements of running, and allows us to mentally recover from the demands of training for and racing in tough events. As ultra runners, it's easy to normalise extreme activities (i.e. it's 'only' 50k), and lose sight of what we are putting our bodies through. Some people call this the 'off season' but let's call it a 'transition phase', from the end of a long period of training and racing  (for me that's 1 x 50k and 2 x 100k) to the beginning of a new season the following year. This gives us some purpose whilst also letting go of the sometimes relentless cycle of training. I'll be doing lots of hiking, climbing, swimming and maybe some cycling and enjoying moving just for the sake of it, with nothing to prove and nothing to achieve. This is also a good time to reflect upon your achievements in the current year, to be proud of where you have improved and look to see what changes you can make to set yourself up for a great season the next year.

### Reflecting on 2022

My goal for this year was to go long and go big in the mountains. This was actually the goal for 2020, but Covid put a hammer to those plans, and even as things eased we were frantically selling / buying houses and awaiting the arrival of our twin girls. I managed one 50k at the Maverick Adidas Terrex Peak District Ultra in 2020 when events could finally go ahead (hands up who did some staggered start / TT style races...urgh) and then the Cotswold Way Century 100 miler in 2021. After two races in two years I wanted 2022 to be full of adventure!

I had planned an attempt at the Bob Graham Round to take place on my 40th birthday in April, but this was prior to finding out we were having twins and those early months would not have be conducive to completing a BG. Not one bit. So rather than an attempt at the round for my birthday, I opted for a recce of legs 3 and 4 guided by the good people at Mountain Run UK. Sadly the weather was against us for leg 4, but leg 3 was excellent. By far the stand out section being the ascent of Lord's Rake and the West Wall Traverse, scrambling through the guts of Scafell. It was nice to enjoy a few beers the day before and later that evening without the pressure of a big event. It was an excellent birthday adventure and perfect prep for a Spring and Summer full of big mountain races. The full BG round is definitely on the cards for the future.

In May I did the Trail Events Brecon Beacons 50k and after opening a convincing lead of around 5 minutes at roughly 9 miles I stupidly went the wrong way with only a few miles remaining. I lost 20 minutes but managed to hang on to 2nd place. More than anything I was really pleased with where my fitness was heading into Ultra Trail Snowdonia 100k in early July. You can read more about that [here][1]. By this stage in the year my legs were far more acustomed to mountain miles than they had been, but UTS in particular was a bit of a shock to the system. After more mountain miles in training in the months following, I felt as though I'd acheived proper mountain legs by mid September at Nice 110k. Read all about that one [here][2]. A huge improvement in technical mountain skills from April through to September, though there is still much work to be done next year, 2022 was a great start.

### Goals for 2023

The main goal for next year is CCC at UTMB. However, I'm relying on the lottery to achieve this, which is entirely out of my hands. So setting that to one side, whether I get into CCC or not, my goals in terms of personal development remain the same:

*More miles.*

*More vert.*

*Better nutrition.*

*Dialled in kit.*

I hit some 60+ mile weeks this year and could have made those 70 mile weeks if logistics had allowed. Family life with a 3 year old and twins under 1 is hectic to say the least. If I was writing this 4 or 5 years ago mileage at that level would be doable, but right now missed sessions for one reason or another are just part of life. So we make do where we can. More vert is an interesting challenge. My 10k / 11k of ascent weeks were great, but more would be helpful. I'm going to need to get creative with this. The Brecon Beacons are my closest mountain range, but with a 90 minute drive each way, it's something of a luxury to get out there (see my point above re: family life). 

Possibly the easiest goal to achieve here whilst also being seemingly the most difficult is nutrition. I need to make serious changes to my diet in order to support those 70 mile / 15k to 20k ascent weeks. Family and work life demands a lot of energy, let alone all that running, and I know it just won't be possible without seriously advancing my game regarding how I'm fueling such an active lifestyle, and how I'm giving my body everything it needs to recover and go again. I think the help of a nutritionist is likely the best way forward. The final goal is dialling in my kit. Something I've learned over two big mountain ultras this year is how important the right kit is. Mandatory kit lists for big mountain races can be extensive. The right choice for you, correctly packed is hugely important. I'll be looking at this soon, way ahead of races in 2023. 

### Races for 2023

This all hangs in the balance of the CCC lottery, so the current plan is rough with two permutations.

*May: UTS 50k (booked!)*

*July: Brecon Beacons 100k*

*September: CCC!*

Or if I'm not lucky in the lottery, and need to collect more running stones, something like:

*May: UTS 50k (booked!)*

*June: Mozart 100*

*September: Nice 111k or Wildstrubel 110k*

But for now, I'm going to kick back, enjoy some other sports and continue to refine these plans to make 2023 the most epic year yet!
