### Finally!

This race has been on my radar since the very first edition. However, every single year the date has clashed with obligations to family and friends (weddings etc) and then of course, the pandemic. However, in 2022 I finally got to experience the epic Ultra Trail Snowdonia, and what better year to do it than when the race was inaugurated into the UTMB World Series. The only UK race with the chance to bag running stones. Whoop! I had this on the calendar for a long time and was so excited when it was finally time to head out on that epic day in the mountains of Snowdonia üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åø. 

### Preparation

Where I live, there are no mountains within reasonable distance for a run before or after work. We have lots of rolling hills up to around 1,000 feet but that's it. With a creative approach I managed fairly consistent weeks of around 50 to 60 miles with roughly 10k / 11k of ascent. Trips to the Malvern Hills and Brecon Beacons helped to spice things up, but with rough Snowdonian terrain and 22k feet of climbing(!) it was always going to be a tough outing come race day. In May I took on the Trail Events - Brecon Beacons 50k and placed 2nd, likely throwing away the win after taking a 20 minute wrong turn when I had a roghly 5 minute lead. Oops! Nonetheless, it showed my mountain legs weren't too bad after all and that fitness was good. Heading into the race I was fit, healthy, and ready.

I arrived in Llanberris the day before the race, enjoying the peaceful long journey. With a 5 hour drive and stopping to charge my car and grab some lunch, I arrived in time to register, sort all of my kit out, grab some dinner and try to get into bed early enough to be well rested for the 4am start! I struggled to sleep so early (I think it was around 8pm) but knew that even just lying in bed would be good enough. I drifted off eventually and was soon woken by a 2:30am alarm. Show time.

### Llanberis - Waunfawr - Bron-y-Fedw - Rhyd-Ddu

Stood on the start line, counting down from 10 as the gun is about to go, I started my watch and was immediately alerted that I was '10,000 miles off course'. The navigation on my watch was completely borked, something I've never seen before or since, just as I was about to head off into the unknown for 60+ mountain miles. Nice one. Thankfully the course was exceptionally well marked so all was good, but not the best thing for calming nerves 10 seconds before go time.

The opening miles were flowing and the scenery was breathtaking. Moel Eilio 'ridge' was spectacular and even though the weather was typically Welsh there was beauty whichever direction you looked. The first two check points passed with relative ease before the first ascent of Snowdon via rocky switch backs of the Ranger Path. It got pretty cold up top and I was looking forward to descending the Rhyd-Ddu Path. All the fun!

### Rhyd-Ddu - Beddgelert

The organiser had put together an excellent detailed route guide and from that I knew this section was going to be intense. The climbs were  relentlessly steep. The two things that really stick out in my mind from this was the incredible scrambling on the Nantlle Ridge and the insane descent down into Beddgelert. Very steep and very technical. I was passed by at least 3 people as I clambered down. Descending terrain this rough and this steep is a very specfic skill and not something that can be easily practised at home. Some work to be done there for sure.

### Beddgelert - Nant Gwynant - Pen-y-Gwryd

The intensity backed off a little between these checkpoints, and the absolute highlight for me was more easy scrambling to the peak of Y Lliwedd. It felt like such an epic adventure! This section had some straight forward, flatish terrain as we geared up for the very tough section ahead.

### Pen-y-Gwryd - Pen-y-Pass

The Glyderau! Incredible views of Tryfan, the shores of Cwm Idwal lake, the Devils Kitchen and finally Glyder Fawr. When things were getting tough in the race, I was mentally focusing on getting to this last very hard section knowing that all of these awesome sights awaited me. I couldn't recce the course, but I'd watched a ton of YouTube vidoes around these areas, so that I could get a feel for these places. It was useful, and the terrain was just as tough as it looked. The descent to the YHA at Pen-y-Pass was another tricky one, more comfortable for fell runners than your average trail runner I imagine! But an excellent learning experience. I was relieved to reach the Pen-y-Pass checkpoint, with one 'simple' ascent of Snowdon left to end the day.

### Pen-y-Pass to Llanberis

As I left the Pen-y-Pass checkpoint, the sun was setting and I'll never forget that moment. I was hoping to make it back to Llanberis before I'd need a head torch, but it was worth it for that epic sunset. Climbing the Pyg Track in the dark was exciting but the fatigue had kicked in hard and I just wanted it to be over. I had company with a couple of other runners which was great. Descending the Llanberis Path should be an easy and fast affair but it felt like none of those things. It dragged on, but eventually we made it to the A road, a quick forest detour and we were heading for the finish line at the National Slate Museum. It's funny finishing long ultras in the dead of night, with nobody there it feels something of an anti-climax but I didn't care. I'd made it and had 3 running stones for the UTMB lottery in the bag. Such a fantastic race, bring on 2023!
