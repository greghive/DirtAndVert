# Improving recovery with Whoop

## 24 November, 2022

A couple of weeks ago, I ordered a Whoop 4. Taking time off from running has given me lots of space to think about what changes I need to make to support increased performance in 2023. As I mentioned in my last post, I felt at times on the cusp of a break through in 2022 and whilst my fitness was high, I could have pushed further if my recovery was better. 

I remembered hearing about Whoop on the Rich Roll podcast and was intrigued but never really looked into it any further. With all this extra time and energy on my hands, I started to research Whoop in more detail, along with Oura. I really liked the look of the Oura ring, especially the fact that it was off your wrist. I rarely wear a watch unless I'm running and have tried tracking sleep with Apple Watch before, but I didn’t find it comfortable to wear all night. I was concerned a Whoop device would irritate me. That being said, I really liked the look of the Whoop app and they seemed much more focused on athletic development as opposed to a more general approach to health and wellbeing that Oura appeard to be targeting. Shame, as I loved the design of the ring. The other issue to consider looking at the two is that Whoop is a subscription service and Oura is an upfront payment plus a small subscription service. Neither option is particularly cheap. With the focus on performance and no large up front cost, I made up my mind up signed up for Whoop 4.

### The first few days

When the device arrived it looked great. I was surprised that it arrived with no charge, but after charging it for an hour or so I put it on my right (non dominant) wrist as per the instructions and waited for it to collect some data from my first nights sleep. It felt relatively comfortable, though having something on that wrist as opposed to my left did feel a little odd. I was unsure whether it was going to be comfortable to wear 24/7, but with a 30 day returns policy I was excited to give it a shot.

The first night was a particular bad nights sleep with our baby daughters and eldest daughter all waking up at various points. The next day it reported I’d had 2.5 hours sleep! It was bad, but not quite that bad. Looking at the data, I could see it had only recorded intermittent heart rate data throughout the night. Perhaps I was wearing it too loosely? I tightened it up and waited to log another nights sleep, hoping to see a full set of data. It did indeed record my sleep that night and it was fascinating to see the various stages of sleep and the duration spent in each along with time asleep vs time in bed. Sadly during the daytime it kept dropping data again. I gave it a couple more days adjusting how I was wearing it but was still getting data drop out intermittently throughout the day. Was I wearing it wrong? Was the device faulty?

After playing around with the app, I noticed that when I started an activity the app was showing an “Off Body” warning. So the device didn’t think I was being worn and had stopped recording data to save battery. I began to wonder if there was an issue being caused by the tattoo on my right wrist, so I reached out to customer services. Whoop customer services was excellent. I sent multiple emails and had replies back each time within less than 10 minutes. The conclusion was they would update my device to a tattoo specific firmware via push notification. As good as the customer service experience was, I haven’t yet actually seen this firmware update. However, whilst waiting I switched the device onto my left wrist and it immediately felt much more comfortable, and that’s where it has now stayed. I’ve only just resumed very easy unstructured training, but when I run I simply switch the Whoop 4 onto my right wrist and put my running watch on my left wrist as normal. So far this has been fine and Whoop has not dropped any activity heart rate whilst I’ve been running. I’ll continue to monitor data recording whilst I’m running and Whoop 4 is on my right wrist. If I have any issues I'll pester customer services and I'm confident that with a bit of prodding, I'd get that firmware update.

### Improved Sleep and Recovery!

So the first few days were spent getting acquainted with the device and the app, figuring out where I was going to wear it and getting consistent data. Then things got interesting. Initially we had some really bad nights sleep with the kids, so I wasn’t surprised to see poor sleep and recovery. My main issue with sleep is wakefulness. Either taking a very long time to get to sleep or waking up regularly through the night. Obviously having a 3 year old and two 1 year olds doesn’t help! So once I had a few days of bad sleep data I was determined to improve this metric. Having Whoop really gamified this for me. I started to research what I could do to improve my quality of sleep. There are a ton of excellent resources on the Whoop website and these articles were particularly useful:

*[13 Tips to Create a Nightly Routine to Sleep Better](https://www.whoop.com/thelocker/13-tips-to-create-a-nightly-routine-to-sleep-better/)*

*[How to Sleep Better at Night Naturally (and with Supplements)](https://www.whoop.com/thelocker/sleep-better-naturally/)*

*[Increase Deep Sleep with WHOOP Data Insights](https://www.whoop.com/thelocker/increase-deep-sleep/)*

From what I’d read in these articles there were a number of things I’d done previously, but never with any intention or consistency. Those were meditation, drinking herbal tea and reading a book (non screened) in bed before going to sleep. So I set about creating a new routine of the following:

*All screens (including TV) switched off from around 9pm.*

*Short meditation of around 10 minutes.*

*Herbal tea.*

*In bed by around 10pm reading a book.*

Almost instantly I saw several amazing changes. My recovery began increasing more and more each day. My heart rate variability (HRV) began to climb over each day of this new routine and my resting heart rate also declined. One of the most interesting things I saw was that my time awake during the night went from around 2 hours down to 16 minutes! I was waking up feeling more and more refreshed every day. Over such a short period of time (around 5 days) it’s difficult to say that this is solely down to my new bedtime routine. The kids have been sleeping a little better, but still plenty of waking up going on. Something else interesting to note is that my time in bed has actually been less. Sometimes I’ve been reading until 11pm which is adding on roughly an extra hour of time before I actually go to sleep. But the quality of my sleep has hugely improved. It’s going to be interesting to see how this goes over the long term. But whatever it is, something is clicking and if I can continue this when proper training resumes I think it’s going to make an enormous difference to my rate of recovery.

I’ve always been interested in tracking heart rate variability (HRV), but never had the tools by which to measure it. Plus as your HRV itself varies so much throughout the day, you’d need to take a reading multiple times per day and that’s just not going to happen. For anyone that isn’t sure what HRV is, it is the differences in time between each beat of your heart. Counter intuitively, it’s a high variance you are looking for to indicate that your body is primed for exercise. A low HRV would indicate you need to take it easy or rest. Whoop tracks this metric when you are in your deepest phase of sleep each night and it’s amazing to have this automatically detected without any effort whilst you are asleep. So cool. I can now use HRV everyday to decide whether to push hard or back off and do the harder sessions when my body is ready to make fitness adaptations.

I’ve only recently resumed light, unstructed training but it has been interesting to see a small amount of strain added to my dataset. It will be very interesting to see how larger strain values effect my recovery when proper training resumes in a couple of weeks. I’m also looking forward to seeing the effects of big races, and also how significant non running life events have an impact on strain and recovery. I absolutely love my Whoop 4. It’s so comfortable I completely forget it’s there and I’ve already seen results in improved sleep in just a few days. There is so much more to explore with this device over a longer period of time, and I can’t wait to see how this helps take my training and racing to the next level in 2023!
