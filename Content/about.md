Hi! My name is Greg Price, and I'm a trail and mountain ultra runner from The Cotswolds UK. I'm 40 years old, a self employed Software Engineer, and Dad to my three beautiful daughters. Welcome to my blog ðŸ‘‹.

I started running 10 years ago when I setup my own company and knew I would be spending a lot of time alone whilst working from home. I decided that running would get me out and about on a daily basis and away from my desk. I soon entered my first event, a 14 mile trail race, which was swiftly followed by my first marathon in London. I began to live a new, healthier life and was enjoying setting goals, training consistently and seeing myself progress. After London, I ran the Amsterdam marathon that same year and began to wonder what else I could achieve. 

I came across triathlon, and more specifically long distance Ironman. I was captivated by how tough it looked and knew I had to give it a go. I learned to swim, bought a bike and got a coach. I did the 70.3 circuit for some years, taking part in many of the UK's biggest events; Exmoor, Stafford, Weymouth, Hever Castle and many local races too. I worked up to my first full distance Ironman and it was by far the most challenging thing I'd ever done.

Our first daughter was born, and the time required to train for swim, bike and run at that distance was no longer feasible. In parallel, I'd begun to feel like I'd achieved everything I wanted in triathlon and had become glued to ultra running videos on YouTube. I felt a renewed fire and that same feeling of wondering "...could I do that?". I was attracted to the beautiful environments these races took place in, and had become bored of cycling on the roads, and running on the pavements. I entered my first ultra, a local 50 miler. I placed 1st Male and knew I'd now found the sport for me!

After finding my feet at 50k and 50 mile distances, I'm now trying to master the longer stuff, at 100k and 100 mile. I love long days out in Brecon Beacons, Snowdonia or the Lake District and also my local trails along the Cotswold Way. My current goal is to race in Chamonix, and all my effort is currently focused on getting to CCC / UTMB. Through this blog, I'll be sharing tales of my adventures in the mountains, reflecting on my experience of training and racing, and sharing my love of the beautiful sport of ultra running.
